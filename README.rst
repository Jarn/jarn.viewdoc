**viewdoc** is a Python package documentation viewer. It converts
reST-formatted text to HTML and displays it in a browser window.
It is typically used to check a package's long description before
uploading it to PyPI.

Also see `jarn.mkrelease`_.

Installation
============

viewdoc works with Python 2.5 - 3.4 and all released versions of setuptools

Then put it on your system PATH by e.g. symlinking it to ``/usr/local/bin``.

your existing ``~/.viewdoc`` file to get the updated styles.
